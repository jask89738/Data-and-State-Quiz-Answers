Question 1)
In React, data flows in one way: from a parent component to a child component.

True
False
Question 2)
Why is one-way data flow important in React?

It ensures that the data is flowing from top to bottom in the component hierarchy.
It ensures that the data is flowing from bottom to top in the component hierarchy.
Question 3)
True or false? State data is the data inside a component that a component can mutate.

True
False
Question 4)
What is prop drilling?

Prop drilling is a situation where you are passing data from a parent to a child component, then to a grandchild component, and so on, until it reaches a more distant component further down the component tree, where this data is required
Prop drilling is a situation where you are passing data from a child, to a parent component, then to a grandparent component, and so on, until it reaches a more distant component further up the component tree, where this data is required.
Question 5)
The distinction between stateful and stateless components is that the latter doesn’t have its own state.

True
False
Question 6)
Choose the correct statement.

Remember that you should always change the values of props in children components; you should never work with them as they are. In other words, props are mutable.

Question 7)
Is this code valid?

function App() {

return ( 
<div> 
<button onClick = {handler} >

}
Yes
No
Question 8)
Is this code valid?

<button onClick={ () => console.log('clicked') }> 
Click me
</button>
Yes
No
Question 9)
Select the correct statement: The useState hook…

… lets you hook into React state and lifecycle features from a component.
…is not part of React; you must import it from a third-party package.
… has a convention that if the state variable is named, for example, counter, the function to update this counter variable should be named counterFunction.
… should never be called at the top level of a React component.
Question 10)
The Context API allows you to:

Avoid having to pass state down through multiple levels of components.
Avoid having to use the return statement in a child component.
Avoid having to keep your components modular.
